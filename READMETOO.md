 create another JS file in your JS homework repo from last night and I want you do do the following in it.

Preform some simple operations with numbers
Preform some simple conditional statements using "if" and "else" and make sure to use variables
Create 10 different objects whose properties have a mix of the following value types (you must use each one at least once)
                -  Number
                -  String
                -  Array
                -  Function
                -  Object

Make sure for all of your JS homework you are commenting what you are doing. I should be able to read it and learn about what you were thinking and why. Please have some fun with this, don't create arbitrary words but create something meaningful... like a person object or an animal object etc.
